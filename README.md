# ðŸ§  FSRS Scheduler (Version 6) â€“ Kotlin Implementation

This repository contains a **Kotlin implementation** of the [Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS)](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition), version **6**. FSRS is a modern algorithm for spaced repetition, optimized using machine learning to improve long-term retention and scheduling efficiency.

> ðŸ”¬ FSRS v6 is the latest official version of the algorithm, offering better accuracy and flexibility compared to older algorithms like SM-2.

---

## âœ… Features

- ðŸ“Œ Based on the **official FSRS v6 specification**
- ðŸ”„ Supports all review responses: `Again`, `Hard`, `Good`, `Easy`
- ðŸ§® Returns updated **stability**, **difficulty**, and **interval**
- ðŸ§± Written in idiomatic **Kotlin**, easy to integrate into Android or JVM projects
- ðŸ•’ Uses `LocalDateTime` for precise due date handling
- ðŸ§ª Suitable for experimentation or direct production use

---

## ðŸ“¦ Use Cases

This FSRS implementation can be used in:

- Flashcard apps (Anki-like)
- Educational software for medical, language, and test prep
- Any Kotlin-based spaced repetition project

---

## ðŸš€ Example Usage

```kotlin
val scheduler = FSRS()

val review = ReviewLog(
    rating = Rating.Good,
    lastReview = LocalDateTime.now().minusDays(3),
    due = LocalDateTime.now(),
    stability = 3.5,
    difficulty = 4.0
)

val result = scheduler.schedule(review)

println("Next Interval: ${result.interval}")
println("Updated Stability: ${result.stability}")
println("Updated Difficulty: ${result.difficulty}")
println("Next Due Date: ${result.due}")
```
